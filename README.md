# NondimPoroelasticity_with_Growth
This repository provides an interface to DOLFINx to simulate poroelastic problems in dimensional- as well as non-dimensional form with the finite-element-method. Problems can de solved based on small or large deformations as well as under consideration of mass exchange.
